## My Schedule
Simple webpage that describes in arbitrary terms about what my schedule is. Being that my classes are all online my schedule is a fairly flexible thing. For the design elements I decided to go with a minimalist approach, as I just do not have a very good asethetic eye for web design as a rule, and I didn't see value in trying to complicate things by adding features to the design purely for the sake of having them.
